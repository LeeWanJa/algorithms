ORA-01034: ORACLE not available
ORA-27101: shared memory realm does not exist
01034. 00000 -  "ORACLE not available"
*Cause:    Oracle was not started up. Possible causes include the following
           - The SGA requires more space than was allocated for it.
           - The operating-system variable pointing to the instance is
           improperly defined.
*Action:   Refer to accompanying messages for possible causes and correct
           the problem mentioned in the other messages.
           If Oracle has been initialized, then on some operating systems,
           verify that Oracle was linked correctly. See the platform
           specific Oracle documentation.
